    <h2>2016 - 2020 Sports Academy Zurich internships 👔</h2>
    <p>
      I believe the most significant work experience I’ve gained in life is learning to balance multiple paths at once. Even though I’m trying to present these lines in a way that resembles a résumé, there isn’t really a strict chronology — some things happened simultaneously, and at times it’s not entirely clear where to draw the line between what was more of a hobby and what was part of "daily work".
      A fitting symbol for this are the four years at the Zurich Sports Academy, which I see as the gateway to a dual-track career.<br><br>Alongside the sports education itself, I completed a four-year commercial apprenticeship that included two internships. The first was at Mobiliar Insurance, and the second at the IGKG Zurich.
      My main responsibilities at both organizations involved working with Microsoft Office programs such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, as well as developing communication skills through customer reception and phone correspondence. I also gained experience using internal business platforms — at Mobiliar, for example, this included systems for managing insurance cases and claims.
      Looking back, both internships were classic administrative service roles, but they taught me essential skills in organization, communication, and professionalism.

    <h2>2014 - 2024 Social Media Manager Rhulani 🐘</h2>
    <p>
      Of course, it’s difficult to say that starting an Instagram account at the age of fifteen immediately counted as “work”. Especially since there was no formal contract at the beginning. <br><br>
      What I want to emphasize with this section is that, over the course of ten years, this experience provided me with a tremendous amount of hands-on, practical knowledge that gradually improved year after year, and ultimately became the foundation for my academic studies.
      Defining the exact moment when this shifted from being a personal hobby, as a son simply trying his best to represent his father’s hotel on social media, to becoming professional, comparable work is extremely difficult. However, what I can say is that, within the family, we established the first kind of work agreement in 2017, both due to my age and my growing skill set. That’s why I often say my actual work experience didn’t begin in 2014, but in 2017.
      <br><br>
      I had to start working with KPIs, deadlines, Meta Business Suite, and more — learning how to manage things in a way that felt professional and structured. The core responsibilities included tasks such as strategic planning, content creation, community management, analysis and reporting, and in certain years, paid advertising — depending on whether a marketing budget was available to work with. Another important part of the job involved collaborating with influencers and supporting specific SEO-related tasks.

      In addition to the typical social media management duties, there were also some smaller, less conventional responsibilities, such as creating email signatures for employees, co-organizing hotel award marketing and voting periods, assisting with travel events, and even set up an app.<br><br>
      Sometimes, especially before the age of AI tools, I reached my limits, and there were areas where I wished I had received more formal training. Since I never had anyone setting guidelines for me and was always focused on delivering results, these experiences ultimately became the main motivation for pursuing my academic studies, to build a solid theoretical foundation alongside the practical knowledge I had already gained. That’s how I found my way to the University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons.

    <h2>2021 - now Freelancer 📊</h2>
    <p>
      In 2021, I had just completed the professional baccalaureate and was in a phase where I was training with Schaffhausen in the Challenge League for about half a year. It was a time when it wasn’t entirely clear whether I might still achieve a breakthrough in sports, and at the same time, the COVID lockdown brought a period of great uncertainty overall.  <br><br>Through football, I was able to earn money for several years on a semi-professional level, but it was never quite enough to consider it a full-time job that could sustain me in the long run.
      Therefore, alongside my long-term position as Social Media Manager for Rhulani, I began taking on freelance projects over several years. <br><br>
      Some of these projects came through personal connections — “Vitamin B,” as we say in German — since I already had plenty of experience in social media and content creation. For example, it was quite easy for me to produce photos and videos of football players and then sell them the licensing rights.
      Because I also wanted to earn some extra income, I joined several freelancer platforms, where I took on various projects.  <br><br>Over time, these experiences not only provided additional financial support but also helped me develop a broader and more versatile skill set.
 
      When I started my Multimedia Production studies in 2023, I quickly realized that the program was highly practice-oriented, which suited me perfectly and led to even more freelance opportunities alongside my studies. <br><br>In our program, beyond the regular semester exams, we worked on numerous graded projects that were directly connected to the real professional world. Many of these assignments involved collaborations with external companies or organizations.
      For example, one of our film projects focused on a youth home in Berlin, which ultimately aired on Alex Berlin TV.

    <h2>2023 - now Content Producer 📹</h2>
    <p>
      Among all the freelance projects and assignments, one long-term collaboration stands out in particular. Since 2023, I’ve been working as a Content Producer for Primetraining. <br><br>
      What I especially appreciate about this collaboration is that it has developed over an extended period of time and is a bit more specialized than a traditional Social Media Manager role.
      In this position, I’m solely responsible for creating the content, which I then hand over for further use. The role also gives me plenty of creative freedom — for example, I frequently use my drone for aerial shots, something that often received less focus in my other projects.
