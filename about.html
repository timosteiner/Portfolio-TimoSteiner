    <h2>Timo Alejandro Steiner 👋</h2>
    <p>Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Raised in Switzerland. And deeply passionate about the safaris of South Africa. These three places are the ones most closely connected to my life.
<br><br>
Even as a child, I was a person full of dreams and curiosity, fascinated by many different things. But two passions always stood out – animals and playing with a ball. Learning that combining these two things might not be the best idea was something I discovered early in life. When my family and I visited a zoo in Argentina where you could touch the animals, I was allowed into an enclosure with tortoises. I started playing football with them – I thought it was hilarious watching them “roll” across the enclosure. Of course, I was too young to understand that I might be hurting them, so I was quickly taken out again. A little later, I got a ball to play with at home, and from then on, both the tortoises and little Timo were happy.
<br><br>
At the age of two, my parents and I moved to Switzerland. By six, I had my first big dream: to become a professional football player. I chased that dream well into my twenties, including a journey to Brazil, where I tried my luck and learned many values that still shape me today. Discipline, goal orientation, resilience, and self-confidence – all of these are values that continue to guide me in both my professional and personal life, and that I carry with me into the future.

    <h2>Sports school and commercial basic education 🎓</h2>
    <p>At the age of fifteen, back in Switzerland, an important decision was on the table – whether to continue focusing on football or to take a more academic path. Since I was looking for a mix of both, we found the perfect solution: a sports school.<br><br>

For four years, I attended the Sports Academy Zurich, where I was able to complete a commercial apprenticeship while still pursuing my dream of becoming a professional football player. In addition to morning and evening training sessions, we also had three years of academic education at the KV Business School Zurich and were required to complete two internships.

The first internship was at Mobiliar Insurance, and the second at IGKG Züri – both in the field of service and administration. Even though at the time I mainly saw this commercial apprenticeship as a safety net for the future, as a plan B, looking back now, I realize how much it has actually helped me.

Years later, during the Multimedia Production studies, we mainly worked with Adobe Creative Cloud, and thanks to my commercial background, I’m also confident working with Microsoft programs, which broadens my overall skill set even further.
<br><br>
At the same time, it was already clear to me back then that if football ever became less central in life, I would still want to keep a creative, expressive aspect as part of it.<br></p>

    <h2>South Africa and University background 🌍</h2>
    <p>
The first time in South Africa was back in 2010, when my family and I went on a road trip across the entire country, coinciding with the Football World Cup that took place there that year. None of us had any personal connection to the country before, but after that journey, we all fell in love with it.

My father went so far as to buy his own safari lodge in March 2013, and for all of us, that moment marked the beginning of a new chapter in life. 

<br><br>Since I was fifteen at the time and naturally more familiar with social media than my parents, I took over all social media responsibilities from the very beginning. These were the more classic social media tasks, but from time to time smaller cross-departmental tasks, such as designing email signatures, organizing hotel award voting processes, coordinating travel events, or setting up an app, came along whenever they were needed.
From the start, I learned to work independently and be my own "boss" – something that, of course, comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Since I never really had a supervisor, I treated the social media work as my own creative playground and became more efficient and detail-oriented year after year.

For more than ten years, these tasks have been a welcome balance to both my commercial education and my football career. And it was through this experience that I realized my desire to further expand this creative and expressive aspect of my life. <br><br> After completing the vocational baccalaureate, I decided to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Multimedia Production at FH Graubünden. In addition to the bachelor’s thesis itself, the main focus areas included the major elective module Non-fictional Video Formats and minor electives such as Digital Marketing, Corporate Social Media, Post Production, My Start-up, and Audio for the 21st Century.<br><br>

    <h2>USP, Equipment and Vlog 🎞️</h2>
    <p>My main goal is first and foremost to share my journey and introduce myself as a person, as I firmly believe that successful collaboration is built on interpersonal connections and communication. <br><br>At the same time, I believe that the recent past always plays an important role, and that it’s also important not to lose sight of the here and now. That’s why I’ve intentionally added an additional section focused on the present, with a link to my video blog, allowing you as a viewer to explore some of my current projects.
I’m someone who truly enjoys taking on new and challenging opportunities and growing together with others through them. That’s also why I’ve linked my equipment, because looking toward the future, I believe that the resources available to us should always be part of the conversation.<br><br>
I see my clear USP in the Wildlife Safari section, and so far, there has never been a lack of equipment in any of my projects. However, if a situation ever arises where very specific gear is required or there are particular ideas for a project, you’re always welcome to contact me directly. In most cases, we’ll certainly find a solution that works well for everyone.<br><br></p>
